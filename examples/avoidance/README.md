These are some (hopefully short-lived) intructions on how to get this avoidance example running in dronekit-python.  These instructions assume you are running under Linux, but with minimal modification should run on other operating systems.

Please note that these instructions will significantly change your environment.  Unless you are quite familiar with how your build environment is put together you may wish to do this in a separate stand-alone environment.

1. Run peterbarker's _source-system-filtering branch_ of dronekit-python

  Given that this README file exists within that branch, this should not be too much of a problem.

  The branch can be cloned from https://github.com/peterbarker/dronekit-python
  ```
  DRONEKIT_TOP=$HOME # e.g.
  cd $DRONEKIT_TOP/dronekit-python
  git remote add peterbarker https://github.com/peterbarker/dronekit-python
  git fetch peterbarker
  git checkout peterbarker/source-system-filtering
  python setup.py build install --user --force
  ```

2. Run a version of pymavlink which contains source system filtering:

  ```
  ARDUPILOT_HOME=$HOME/ardupilot # e.g.
  cd $ARDUPILOT_HOME/modules/mavlink/pymavlink
  git remote add peterbarker https://github.com/peterbarker/pymavlink
  git fetch peterbarker
  git checkout peterbarker/mavsource
  python setup.py build install --user --force
  ```

  Note that in the above shell code we are re-using a pymavlink
  repository present in a buildable ArduPilot repository.  You can
  instead clone the pymavlink tree directly.

3. Run peterbarker's avoidance MAVProxy branch

  ```
  MAVPROXY_HOME=$HOME/ardupilot # e.g.
  cd $MAVPROXY_HOME
  git remote add peterbarker https://github.com/peterbarker/MAVProxy
  git fetch peterbarker
  git checkout avoidance
  python setup.py build install --user --force
  ```

4. Connect a GCS to port 3456

  This varies by GCS.  With *MAVProxy* you might run this:
  ```
  mavproxy.py --master udpin:localhost:3456
  module load avoidance
  ```

  With *GQGroundControl* you might try this:
    ```
    - run qgroundcontrol
    - Hamburger -> Comm Links
    - Add (near the bottom of the screen)
     - Type: UDP
     - Listening port 3456
    ```

5. Run the avoidance sample program:
  ```
  DRONEKIT_TOP=$HOME # e.g.
  ARDUPILOT_HOME=$HOME/ardupilot
  export PYTHONPATH=$DRONEKIT_TOP/dronekit-python
  cd $DRONEKIT_TOP/dronekit-python/examples/avoidance
  # this assumes you are compiling your own ArduPilot binary:
  python avoidance.py --binary $ARDUPILOT_HOME/build/sitl-debug/bin/arducopter-quad --resolution=PERPENDICULAR --defaults=$ARDUPILOT_HOME/Tools/autotest/copter_params.parm --extra-connection=udpout:localhost:3456
  ```
6. What you should see:
 - two quadcopters should both enter guided mode
 - both should rise to 5m
 - one of the copters will start to head north
 - a second quadcopter will start to head north-north-west
 - the second quadcopter will approach too closely to the first quadcopter and take a perpendicular course to the first quadcopter
